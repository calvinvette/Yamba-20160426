This is a re-creation of the solution from "Learning Android", modified slightly for class on 26 April 2016

It includes minor corrections and updates from the book's solution including altering the domain of the server to newcircle.com (from marakana.com),
as well as project settings for Android Studio (we used version 2.0 in class) from the book's Eclipse-based project.
